Community fork of the KTaNE Modkit.

The [original (official) modkit](https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit) isn't going to receive updates anymore. This is the fork that will be maintained from now on.

On this branch, community-made modding features are added to the modkit.

A modkit with only the base features can be found on the [base_fatures branch](https://github.com/qkrisi/ktanemodkit/tree/base_features).
